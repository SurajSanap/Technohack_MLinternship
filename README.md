## Machine Learing Models

# Wine Quality Analysis and Classification
This project involves the analysis and classification of wine quality using Python. It utilizes popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.

# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
This repository contains Python code for performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews using deep learning techniques. It demonstrates how to preprocess text data, create a deep learning model, and make predictions on test data.

# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook named "Diabetes Pred task 1.ipynb" for a machine learning project focused on predicting diabetes in patients based on various features. The project utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.


## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## Preprocessing

Text preprocessing is a crucial step in sentiment analysis. In the code, text data is preprocessed by:

- Removing HTML tags
- Removing URLs
- Removing special characters and punctuation
- Tokenizing the text
- Removing emojis
- Cleaning non-alphabetical characters
